## Task
Make a Next.js app hosted on Vercel. The app should have a simple frontend with two input fields and one button to submit an API request. The API endpoint should use the Ethers.js library to detect all transfer events within a given block range (the two fields on the frontend should be used to supply these values) from the Pudgy Penguins smart contract and return a json object containing each address that made the transfer of the penguin and how many transfers they made. Display the returned data in a two column table format on the screen.


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
